## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Engineering Tips

#### Be Specific
```
‚ùå "Generate a car"
‚úÖ "Generate a vintage 1960s muscle car, cherry red, 
   parked in front of a retro diner, golden hour lighting"
```

#### Use Style References
```
"In the style of Studio Ghibli"
"Artstation trending"
"Unreal Engine render"
"Oil painting technique"
```

#### Negative Prompts
```python
prompt = "Beautiful landscape"
negative_prompt = "people, text, watermark, low quality, blurry"
```

### Model Selection Strategy

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Quick iteration | flux_schnell | 2-3 second generation |
| Final quality | flux_dev | Better details |
| Artistic style | sdxl | More artistic control |
| Video from image | svd | Most stable |
| Long music | musicgen_large | Better quality |

## Code Integration Examples

### Python Script
```python
import os
import subprocess

# Set API key
os.environ['FAL_KEY'] = 'your-key'

# Run server
subprocess.run(['fal-mcp'])
```

### Node.js Integration
```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

// Start MCP server
const mcp = spawn('fal-mcp', {
  env: {
    ...process.env,
    FAL_KEY: 'your-key'
  }
});
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  fal-mcp:
    image: ghcr.io/raveenb/fal-mcp-server
    environment:
      - FAL_KEY=${FAL_KEY}
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

## Batch Processing Examples

### Multiple Variations
```python
# Generate 4 variations of the same concept
for i in range(4):
    generate_image(
        prompt="Futuristic city skyline",
        seed=i * 1000  # Different seeds
    )
```

### Style Exploration
```python
styles = ["photorealistic", "anime", "oil painting", "watercolor"]
for style in styles:
    generate_image(
        prompt=f"Mountain landscape in {style} style"
    )
```

## Performance Optimization

### Fast Prototyping
```python
# Use schnell for quick iterations
model="flux_schnell"
image_size="square"  # Smaller = faster
num_images=1
```

### Production Quality
```python
# Use dev/pro for final output
model="flux_dev"
image_size="landscape_16_9"
num_images=4  # Generate options
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Blurry Images
**Solution**: Add quality modifiers
```
"highly detailed, sharp focus, 4k, high resolution"
```

### Issue: Wrong Style
**Solution**: Be more specific
```
"photorealistic" vs "cartoon" vs "oil painting"
```

### Issue: Unwanted Elements
**Solution**: Use negative prompts
```
negative_prompt="text, watermark, signature, border"
```
